RFC1751
=======

RFC-1751 library for Haskell.

Convert 128-bit bytestrings from or to strings containing 12 short English
words for mnemonics. Follows RFC-1751 standard exactly.

This library was originally written for the Haskoin project, but it was spinned
out into its own package to use a different scheme there.
